<h2>Install</h2>
<p>npm init -y
npm install @11ty/eleventy --save-dev
npx @11ty/eleventy
npx @11ty/eleventy --serve</p>
<h2>Set Up</h2>
<p>I try to stay mainly to the defaul 11ty structure. Some folders are declared in the config, &quot;.eleventy.js:,   The site's index file is in the root of the project.  Posts are in a folder called &quot;posts&quot;, layouts in &quot;_layouts&quot;, data into &quot;_data&quot;, webc components in &quot;_components&quot;. NB  css is in &quot;_components/css&quot;.</p>
<h2>CSS</h2>
11ty bundles the most specific CSS at the top. "Most specific" means which template it is in.  Do a deeper, nested template is "more specific".  This can be a problem. 
<p>If we link to a stylesheet in the head &quot;css/styles.css&quot;
11ty will look for styles to bundle in &quot;_components/css/styles.css&quot;.
We can link to &quot;vars.css&quot;, reset.css&quot;, &quot;colors.css&quot;, &quot;type.css&quot; etc
in the  head of the site.  11ty will bundle them inline in the right order for us.</p>
<p>If we wanted to keep a link to a stylesheet, eg for Google fonts, we can use webc:keep in the link.</p>
